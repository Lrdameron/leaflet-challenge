## 🚀 Overview

This interactive Leaflet dashboard visualizes global earthquake activity over the past 7 days using real-time data from the USGS.  
Markers are sized by magnitude and color-coded by depth to provide quick insights into seismic intensity and location.

The project includes both core and bonus features, including tectonic plate boundaries and multiple map layer controls.
